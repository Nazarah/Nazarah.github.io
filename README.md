My first UX Portfolio Website, made from scratch

This repository contains the markup and stylesheet for my homepage.
The site has been designed using Bootstrap 4.
My most recent resume and portfolio of some of my works can be obtained here.

Feel free to make an issue if you find any bug or have an improvement suggestion.

Thanks!

****** UPDATE: January 31st, 2019 ******

I have used a customized template and associated scripts from https://mdbootstrap.com/
I have used the free version to make the new UI of the webpage.
The smooth scrolling functionality however is included separately as the free version doesnt come with this feature.

The new version has animations which works both on desktop and mobile.
Also I have been practicing illustration for a while so decided to recreate my skillsets using them.
